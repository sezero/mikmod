  Hello folks !


This is MikMod, version 3.2.8, a module player for DOS.
Comments & feedback are welcome.


>> BUILDING MIKMOD
------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for DOS, then you're lost in the sources.
  Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

This port has been designed to work only with DJGPP compiler. However, it
should not be too complex to make it compile with any other compiler. If you
manage to make libmikmod compile and work with another compiler, we'd like to
hear from you. You'll likely have to write an appropiate makefile, or build
things manually ...

You should have pre-built libmikmod.a either in %DJGPP%/lib or in $(MIKMOD)
(see Makefile) directory. Refer to the libmikmod source for instructions on
how to build libmikmod under DOS.

If you have all proper tools installed, just type

    make -f Makefile.dj

You should end up with a MIKMOD.EXE binary in the current directory.


>> USING MIKMOD
---------------

Run MikMod with the ``--help'' parameter to get the available options.
Program documentation is available as an Unix man page (..\src\mikmod.1) which
you can read if you've got a port of the 'man' tool.

Also, after you've run MikMod for the first time, you might want to
customize your mikmod.cfg file, either from the configuration panel or by
editing the file yourself, so you won't need to supply the same options to
MikMod all the time. This file will be created in  in C:\

Once you're in the player, pressing the H key will give you an help screen with
the list of the keys you can use. I hope it's understandable.


>> THANKS
---------

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some other

wouldn't be much fun without you.
