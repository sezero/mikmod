  Hello folks !


This is MikMod, version 3.2.8, a module player for OS/2.
As usual with each new version, there's a lot of bugfixes and improvements.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more information.


>> BUILDING MIKMOD
------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for OS/2, then you're lost in the sources.
  Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So you're on a good old OS/2 system, aren't you ? With a customized Object
Desktop or some equivalent tool collection ?

I hope you've installed REXX support during the system installation. If you
didn't, you lose. Run 'selective install' from the system setup folder, install
REXX support, check it works, and come back here.

The first thing you need is to get and compile the libmikmod sound library,
which is not bundled with MikMod anymore !
If you don't know where to get libmikmod, look at the "contact and download
info" section later in this document.

You need long filenames to compile MikMod, so you'll have to compile it
on an HPFS drive, or an ext2fs drive, or a network drive where you can
use decent-size filenames.

Currently, MikMod can be build under OS/2 only with the Watcom compiler (tested
with OpenWatcom 1.9), or with the EMX compiler (not tested). Edit the makefiles
if you need to customize the build options and/or want to learn any details.

For EMX, run:
    make -f Makefile.emx

For Watcom, run:
    wmake -f Makefile.wat

and you'll get your MikMod binary in this directory. Just copy the
file 'mikmod.exe' somewhere in your PATH, and enjoy !

If the build fails, I'd like to hear from you to correct the problem.


>> USING MIKMOD
---------------

Run MikMod with the '--help' parameter to get the available options.
Program documentation is available as an Unix man page (..\src\mikmod.1) which
you can read if you've got a port of the 'man' tool.

Also, after you've run MikMod for the first time, you might want to
customize your mikmod.cfg file, either from the configuration panel or by
editing the file yourself, so you won't need to supply the same options to
MikMod all the time. This file will be created in the directory pointed to by
the HOME environment variable. If you don't have the HOME environment variable,
the file will be created in C:\, which is probably not what you want and should
encourage you to have the HOME environment variable set.

Once you're in the player, pressing the H key will give you an help screen with
the list of the keys you can use. I hope it's understandable.


>> THANKS
---------

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some other
names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping MikMod alive
wouldn't be much fun without you.

There's a mailing list (mikmod-public) for discussing the development
of MikMod (new features, bugs, ideas...) Look for more information on
the web site.


>> LAST NOTES
-------------

I hope you'll enjoy using this version of MikMod as well as I enjoyed
debugging and improving it.
