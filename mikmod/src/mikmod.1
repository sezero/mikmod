.TH MIKMOD 1 "Version 3.2.9, 20 April 2021"


.SH NAME
mikmod - play soundtracker etc. modules on a Unix machine.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mikmod [\fB\-options\fR]... [\fBmodule\fR|\fBplaylist\fR]...


.SH DESCRIPTION


\fIMikMod\fR is a \fIvery\fR portable module player based on libmikmod, written
originally by Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak). It will play the IT, XM, MOD, MTM,
S3M, STM, ULT, FAR, MED, DSM, AMF, IMF and 669 module formats. It works under
AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OSF/1, SunOS, Solaris,
OS/2, DOS, and Windows. It is controllable via an easy-to-use curses
interface and will extract and play modules from a variety of
different archive formats.


.SH OPTIONS


Options can be given in any order, and are case-sensitive. For the options
which have both a short and a long form, the long form can be prefixed by one
or two dashes. Note that the settings in your $HOME/.mikmodrc will override the
defaults shown in this man page.


.SH OUTPUT OPTIONS


.IP "\fB\-d \fIn\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-driver \fIn\fR"
Use the specified device driver for output, 0 is autodetect. The default is 0.
If your installed libmikmod engine is recent enough (>=3.1.7), you can also
specify the driver with an alias, as well as driver options separated by
commas. The list and driver aliases and recognized options can be found in
libmikmod's documentation.
.IP "\fB\-o[utput] \fI8m\fR|\fI8s\fR|\fI16m\fR|\fI16s\fR"
Output settings, 8 or 16 bit in stereo or mono. The default is "16s".
.IP "\fB\-f \fIfreq\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-frequency \fIfreq\fR"
Set mixing frequency in hertz. The default is 44100.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-interpolate\fR"
Use interpolated mixing. This will generally improve audio quality, at the
expense of a bit more CPU usage. Note that this option alters the behaviour of
software drivers only ; hardware drivers are not affected (default).
.IP "\fB\-\-nointerpolate\fR"
Do not use interpolated mixing.
.IP "\fB\-hq\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-hqmixer\fR"
Use high quality software mixer. This improves audio quality, but requires a lot
more CPU power. Note that this option alters the behaviour of software drivers
only ; hardware drivers are not affected.
.IP "\fB\-\-nohqmixer"
Do not use high quality software mixer (default).
.IP "\fB\-s\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-surround\fR"
Use surround mixing.
.IP "\fB\-\-nosurround\fR"
Do not use surround mixing (default).
.IP "\fB\-r \fIn\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-reverb \fIn\fR"
Sets reverb amount from 0 (no reverb) to 15 (max reverb). The default is 0 (no
reverb).


.SH PLAYBACK OPTIONS


.IP "\fB\-v \fIvolume\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-volume \fIvolume\fR"
Set volume from 0% (silence) to 100%. The default is 100%.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-fadeout\fR"
Fade out the volume during the last pattern of each module.
.IP "\fB\-\-nofadeout\fR"
Do not fade out the volume during the last pattern of each module (default).
.IP "\fB\-l\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-loops\fR"
Enable in-module backwards loops.
.IP "\fB\-\-noloops\fR"
Disable in-module backwards loops (default).
.IP "\fB\-a\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-panning\fR"
Process panning effects (default). This should be disabled (using \-\-nopanning)
for very old demo modules which use the panning effects for synchronization
purposes.
.IP "\fB\-\-nopanning\fR"
Do not process panning effects.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-protracker\fR"
Enable protracker extended speed effect (default). This should be disabled
(using \-\-noprotracker) for very old demo modules which use the extended speed
effect for synchronization purposes.
.IP "\fB\-\-noprotracker\fR"
Disable protracker extended speed effect.


.SH LOADING OPTIONS


.IP "\fB\-y \fIdir\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-directory \fIdir\fR"
Scan directory recursively for modules.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-curious\fR"
Look for hidden patterns in module. Most modules don't have hidden patterns,
but you can find "bonus" patterns (or just silence) in some modules.
.IP "\fB\-\-nocurious\fR"
Do not look for hidden patterns in module (default).
.IP "\fB\-p \fIn\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-playmode \fIn\fR"

.IP "\fB\-\-tolerant\fR"
Don't halt MikMod if a module cannot be read or is an unknown format (default).
.IP "\fB\-\-notolerant\fR"
Halt MikMod if a module cannot be read or is an unknown format.


.SH SCHEDULING OPTIONS


The following options need root privileges (or a setuid root binary), and
don't work under all systems.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-renice\fR"
Renice to \-20 if possible to gain more CPU priority. This option is only

Do not reschedule MikMod to gain real\-time priority (default).


.SH DISPLAY OPTIONS


.IP "\fB\-q\fR"
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fR"
Quiet mode. Disables interactive commands and displays only errors.


.SH INFORMATION OPTIONS


.IP "\fB\-n\fR"

.SH MENU BASICS


Some functions of MikMod are available through menus, in the playlist and
configuration panels.

You can select commands in the menus either by moving the selection with the
arrow keys and pressing enter, or entering the highlighted letter corresponding
to the command you want to select.

Menu entries ending with a \fB>\fR character open a submenu, whereas entries
ending in \fB...\fR open a dialog box. You can dismiss a submenu either by
choosing a command in this menu, or using the left arrow key to go back, or
switching panels.

In dialog boxes, you can move the focus from the input line to the \fBOk\fR and
\fBCancel\fR buttons either with the "tab" key, or the up and down arrow keys.

Also, if the statusbar is active (which is the default behaviour), it will
contain a short help text describing the menu option currently highlighted.


.SH PLAYLIST MENU


When the playlist panel is displayed, pressing the \fIreturn\fR key will popup
a menu. The menu commands are:

.IP "\fBPlay\fR"
Continue list playback from the currently highlighted module.
.IP "\fBRemove\fR"
Remove module from the playlist.
.IP "\fBDelete...\fR"
Remove module from the playlist, and delete module file on disk, or whole
archive if the module is stored in an archive file. This function asks you to
confirm your choice.
.IP "\fBFile >\fR"
This entry opens a submenu with four commands, "\fBLoad\fR", "\fBInsert\fR",
"\fBSave\fR" and "\fBSave as\fR". The \fBLoad\fR and \fBInsert\fR commands ask
you for a filename, and replace the playlist with it (load) or merge it with
the playlist (insert). No wildcards are allowed. The \fBSave\fR and
\fBSave as\fR commands save the current playlist in a file, by default
``playlist.mpl'', in the current directory. Note that playlist filenames should
end in \fB.mpl\fR, or they won't be recognized immediately as a playlist by MikMod.
.IP "\fBShuffle\fR"
Randomize the playlist.
.IP "\fBSort >\fR"
This entry opens a submenu with sort commands. You can select a normal or
\fBreverse\fR order, and then sort the playlist with one of the four criteria:
\fBby name\fR, \fBby extension\fR, \fBby path\fR or \fBby time\fR. 
.IP "\fBBack\fR"
Discards the menu.


.SH CONFIGURATION PANEL


The configuration panel lets you customize your MikMod settings, and save them.
You can also try some particular settings without losing your previous
configuration.

.IP "\fBOutput options\fR"
This section lets you choose various vital playback settings, such as the output
driver, the stereo/mono and 16/8 bit output settings, the playback frequency,
and the software mixer settings.
.IP "\fBPlayback options\fR"
This section lets you choose various module playback settings, such as the
output volume, the processing of panning effects and bacwards loops, etc.
.IP "\fBOther options\fR"
This section lets you choose the remaining settings, such as the playlist mode,
and various program settings.

.IP "\fBUse config\fR"
This command activates the current configuration settings, but does not save
them.
.IP "\fBSave config\fR"
This command saves and activates the current configuration settings.
.IP "\fBRevert config\fR"
This command reverts to the on-disk configuration file settings.

.SH ARCHIVE FORMATS


MikMod should recognize and extract the following common archive formats.
However, to use each of these you will need to find the appropriate
program(s) for MikMod to use to extract them. These are commonly available
and you will most likely find them with this distribution of MikMod.
Other archive formats can be configured by editing the configuration
file (see \fBFILES\fR below).
