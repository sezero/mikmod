This is the instructions to compile mikmod on win32.

Mikmod can be compiler using Microsoft Visual Studio, lcc-win32,
or MinGW or MinGW-w64 compilers.

1) First, compile libmikmod, and install it.

   To install libmikmod, I copied libmikmod.lib (generated
   when compiling libmikmod) in the /lib directory of lcc.
   Next, I copied the file mikmod.h in the /include directory
   of lcc.  Should be similar if you used MinGW[-w64] or MSVC.

2) Compiling mikmod:

 - using lcc:
   cd to the win32 directory and type make -f Makefile.lcc

 - using MinGW or MinGW-w64:
   cd to the win32 directory and type make -f Makefile.mingw
   (you need GNU make: gmake, or mingw32-make, or whatever)

 - using MSVC:
   Compile using project files from MSVC6 or VS2005. The VS2005
   project file imports just fine into newer Visual Studio versions,
   e.g. VS2012.

   Hopefully, it will compile and a file named mikmod.exe will be
   created.

3) Try it!
   There are 2 audio drivers for windows.
   - DirectSound Driver (Requires DirectX 6 or newer)
   - waveform-audio

   Depending on how you compliled libmikmod, the XAudio2 driver,
   and possibly others may be there too.

   To choose which driver to use from the command line,
   do a mikmod -n to get the list of drivers, and once you
   know the correct driver id, do mikmod -d ?? where ?? is the id.

   do mikmod -h for more command line options.

Good Luck!
