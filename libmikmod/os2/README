  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.3.13, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for OS/2, then you're lost in the
  sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So you're on a good old OS/2 system, aren't you ? With a customized
Object Desktop or some equivalent tool collection ?

I hope you've installed REXX support during the system installation. If
you didn't, you lose. Run 'selective install' from the system setup
folder, install REXX support, check it works, and come back here.

Currently, libmikmod can be build under OS/2 only with the Watcom compiler
(tested with OpenWatcom 1.9) or with the EMX compiler (not tested). You'll
need the MMPM/2 toolkit (included in all the Warp toolkits) to compile the
MMPM/2 driver. The Warp4 toolkit is required if you want to build the DART
driver, too.

You need long filenames to compile libmikmod, so you'll have to compile it
on an HPFS drive, or an ext2fs drive, or a network drive where you can
use decent-size filenames.

For EMX, run:
    make -f Makefile.emx dll

For Watcom, run:
    wmake -f Makefile.wat

and you'll get your mikmod3.dll and its import lib in this directory.
Edit the makefiles in case you need to customize the build options, or
you want to make a static library, and/or want to learn any details.

If the build fails, I'd like to hear from you to correct the problem.

To make you library ready to use, copy the file '..\include\mikmod.h'
to your compiler include directory, and 'mikmod.lib' to your compiler
library directory. If you built a DLL, put the DLL (mikmod3.dll) in a
directory which appears in your LIBPATH.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.


>> THANKS
---------

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some
other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.
