Compilation
===========

Most importantly are Mikmod's dependencies.  Mikmod requires the 'mmio' lib-
raries and header files in order to be compiled properly.  The mmio lib is
relatively small and simple and is normally distributed with Mikmod.

The source tree looks like this:

src [Contains the 'main' or otherwse uncatagorizable mikmod code]
 \
  virtch  [software mixer code.  C and Assembly code]
  loaders [All module loaders]
  drivers [All non-OS specific drivers (disk writiers)]
  \
   dos    [MS-DOS Specific Drivers]
   win32  [Windows waveout and directsound drivers]
   linux  [Linux drivers, Alsa, OSS, whatever]
   sdl    [SDL drivers for Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix, whatever]

For now, the source is divided up for organizational purposes only, and when
you create your makefile, you need only generate one .LIB file.  We will
make considerations about dividing the source into seprate .LIB files at a 
later date.  The modules to be compiled look like this:


src
  mdriver.c
  mloader.c
  mplayer.c
  munitrk.c
  npertab.c
  sloader.c
  unimod.c  - If I call it munimod.c, it will be the same length too.. hmm :)
  
loaders
  load_mod.c
  load_m15.c
  load_xm.c
  load_it.c
  load_s3m.c
  load_stm.c
  s3m_it.c  
    - unified pattern/effects conversion code because the three formats have
      more in common than they do different.
      
  Note: All other loaders present in the loaders/ dir do NOT currently work.
    I have not had an opportunity to convert them to the new unitrk stream
    and test them, so don't try to use them!
    
drivers:
  drv_wav.c
  drv_raw.c
  
  Note: There are no native Linux drivers yet.  If you need to test, use
    the SDL, wave-out or raw-out disk writers for now.  Once mikmod itself
    works under linux, I can convert an older driver file to the new API in
    a snap.
    
mmio
  mmio.c
  mmerror.c
  mmalloc.c
  
virtch
  virtch.c - Define __ASSEMBLY__ if you want to use the assembly mixers.
  vc8norm.c
  vc16norm.c
  vc8nc.c  \  Clickless mixers.  These have no assembly counterparts since
  vc16nc.c /  they are used so sparsely (they do micro-volume ramping).

  resample.nasm 
    - the non-working NASM version of the 8 bit mixers.  Feel free to scan
      over this if you so wish.  If someone can make it work, well.. that
      would be really nice :)

For the current Mikmod compilation, there are NO compiler options required,
UNLESS you are working on a big endian machine, in which case you must use
"MM_BIG_ENDIAN" on all modules.  I have not tested mikmod for 100% big-
endian compatability in a long time, and there could be some issues with it,
particuarly in virtch.c, where I had to use some wacky 64 bit int pointer
tricks to get the code as optimal as possible on 32-bit platforms.

Structure Alignment/Packing:
   Mikmod is most optimal when working with smaller structures, which means
   8 byte structure alignment is a big no-no.  Four bytes is good, and ac-
   tually, 2 bytes seems to be best.  Mikmod also currently relies on struct
   elements being in the same order in memory as in code (for memcpy opt-
   imizations).  Visual C, for one, does not gaurantee this in packed struct
   mode, which leads to improper playback.  Just something to look out for.


Microsoft Visual C++ 6
======================

Due to verious 'difficulties' in supporting prior versions of Visual C, we
have only included makefiles for Visual C 6.  This is probably a good thing
anyway because VC5 is known to have several interface instabilities and bugs
in code generation (bad!).  I realize some people are just stuck with VC5,
but the bottom line is: you really should upgrade.

Onto the useful information:  Mikmod includes a global workspace (which con-
tains all examples and the mikmod and mmio libraries) along with individual
projects for each example and for the library version of mikmod.  Using the
workspace is good for inital 'compile tests,' however once you know that mik-
mod is correctly installed you will want to make your own workspace and in-
clude mikmod into that.

Including Mikmod into Your Project:

Generally, the *best* way to do this is to simply add the mikmod/src/mikmod.dsp
project file to your workspace/project (via 'Add project to workspace).  Then
you go to Project Dependencies and make sure mikmod is checked under your
project.  Finally, you have to edit your project settings:

- add mikmod\include and mmio\include to your Active Project's include paths,
  under C/C++ options (Preprocessor option under the combo box).

- Add dxguid.lib and winmm.lib to your active project!
  [Under Project Options, Link tab]

- Ensure that you are using Multithreaded and Debug Multithreaded CRT libraries,
  configured under Code Generation.

- Use _cdecl calling convention for debug, and _fastcall calling convention for
  Release, also under Code Generation.

Known problems:
 - Compiling with packed structures seems causes mikmod to play some modules
   incorrectly.  It has to do with an optimization in the player which 
   copies structures.  You shouldn't be using packed structs anyway so this
   shouldn't be a problem.  If it is, I can fix it for you.  Drop me a line
   at air@hour13.com.

GCC
===

Mikmod is portable enough to compile under some versions of GCC. The
limiting factor seems to be the lack of support for unnamed structs
and unions in all but the newest versions of GCC. In other words,
Mikmod will probably compile on the latest GCC, but anything older than
2.95.2 is doomed to fail with missing struct and union members or the
like. The following have been tested.

	Compiler		OS	Functionality
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	GCC 2.95.2 (Mingw32)	Win32	Works, but spouts lots of warnings.
	GCC 2.96-RH (Red Hat)	Linux	Works, but spouts lots of warnings.
	GCC 2.81		Solaris	No anon. struct/union support.	
	GCC 2.95		Irix	No anon. struct/union support.

Most of the warning messages seem to be caused by Jake's habit of
declaring function pointers of one type (e.g. void *func(void *)) and
initialising them with pointers to slightly different functions
(e.g. void *func(char *)). These appear to be harmless, but may cause
portability problems in theory.

GCC also seems to complain a lot about the extensive bit-shifting in
the fixed-point arithmetic (shift count too large for variable type
et.c.). The code appears to be OK, so these messages can be ignored.

In the future, steps may be taken to improve portability and get rid
of mysterious warnings.

To compile Mikmod under GCC, use one of the following makefiles with
GNU Make:

	OS	Driver		Makefile
	----------------------------------------
	Linux	SDL		Makefile
	Win32	SDL		Makefile.Win32SDL
	Win32	DirectX 6	Makefile.dx6

Note that the Win32 makefiles are designed for Mingw32 with Cygwin;
in other words, you should have a Unix-style compilation environment.
The SDL home page at http://www.libsdl.org/ provides this in a
convenient package.

The Linux version should work under other Unix variants, but has not
yet been successfully compiled on anything but Linux. The Linux makefile
also currently assumes a little-endian architecture such as Intel x86.
See the porting instructions for details on using Mikmod with big-endian
systems.

The GCC Makefiles are set up to produce a dynamically linked library
(.so in Linux, .DLL in Windows (cdecl calling convention)). In both
cases a corresponding import library (.a) is generated; link your code
with this to use the DLL/so.

The makefiles assume that the mikmod and mmio libraries are in the same
directory, i.e.:

lib
  mikmod
  mmio

If you check out both libraries from CVS at the same time, this should
happen anyway.

Compiling the Example, mikplay.exe
----------------------------------

This one is quite simple.  In examples/mikplay/ you find the mikplay sources.
Only two files are used in the example:

  mikplay.c
  message.c

Currently, for your convienence, mikplay.exe defaults to the waveout driver.
Change this to raw if you prefer.  So just compile those two files and link
it with the mikmod.lib generated above and.. well.. hope for the best!


Mikmod API
----------

If you are familiar with the old mikmod, then you will notice real quick that
this one is very different under the hood.  I removed almost all global var-
iables, except for those used static with a single module only.  I renamed
a lot of stuff, and added some new features.

Currently the only part of mikmod which is not multi-thread friendly is the
driver itself, and likewise the driver (mdriver.c code, I mean) is still the
portion I am least happy with.

Suugestions and recommendations on the API are encouraged, especially for
anything that is not linux or multithread friendly.

Documentation
-------------

There is none.  Obviously.  We will work on that later, once the API is more
complete.


Conclusion
----------

I hope I didn't miss anything of particular importance.  If you have any
questions (and remember, if you have problems, it is probably a good idea
to ask me because I do know the source like the back of my hand - I dunno
how many times people have spent hours, or days, working on something that 
I fixed in minutes), then contact me via:
