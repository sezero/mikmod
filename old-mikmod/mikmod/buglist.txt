(#1)
some clicking, associated with Clicking proper, like the no-clicking system just isn't working.  Bug is reproduceable with the pianob.rar file obtainable from zeromus and the following mikmod_init():


device = Mikmod_Init(44100, 60, NULL, MD_STEREO, CPU_AUTODETECT,
                     DMODE_16BITS | DMODE_INTERP | DMODE_NOCLICK);

reporter: zeromus
status:
update: fixed in some cases, include pianob.rar

(possibly related to (#1))
Mikplay crashes when initialized without DMODE_NOCLICK.  Is the declicking system under construction somehow?

reporter: zeromus
status:
update: Well, I fixed a bug that crashed Mikplay and lots of other stuff when
changing modules with the declicker active - the declicker was trying to declick
using an unloaded sample. I kludged this by reseting the declicker on sample
unload; now Mikplay works fine. I assume you meant that it crashed with the
declicker on (the crash report appears to contradict itself on this point).

(#3)
When mikmod_init() is used with CPU_AUTODETECT things crash nasty-like.  Can be fixed by putting CPU_NONE.  
Noticed commented autodetection code.  is this why?

(#4)
When these three lines are executed:

Mikmod_RegisterDriver(drv_ds);
device = Mikmod_Init(44100, 60, NULL, MD_STEREO, CPU_NONE ,DMODE_16BITS | DMODE_INTERP | DMODE_NOCLICK);
vs = Voiceset_Create(device, NULL, 8, MDVS_DYNAMIC);

And Mikmod_update() is called at any rate, after a random interval of time it will crash in VC_WriteSamples()

The number of voices in the voiceset is irrelevant.  The driver used must be drv_ds to reproduce the bug.

SUGGESTED BUGFIX:
Make vc->SetMode() re-initialize vc by calling vc->Init()
